# MNIST Digit Recognition using MATLAB

This is the neural network implementation of handwritten digit recognition based on Michael Nielsen's book: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html?) Chapter 1. This matlab code is a modified version of his python code which can be found [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning). 

This program was run in MATLAB 2016b. The main file is digitRecognition.m. In this file, you can configure the number of hidden layers, number of nodes per layers, number of training epochs, learning rate, and the size of the mini batches.
